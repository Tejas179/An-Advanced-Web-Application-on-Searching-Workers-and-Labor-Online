# An-Advanced-Web-Application-on-Searching-Workers-and-Labor-Online

Our web application, called "Online Workers and 
Labor Searching," offers a user-friendly search 
platform where laborers and workers can register and 
update their details and skills. To ensure convenience, 
we have developed the user functionalities as a web 
application. Users can provide reviews and feedback 
about businesses, which can be viewed by others. It's 
common for workers to beunavailable or inefficient at 
times, and some may struggle to find daily work to 
meet their needs. This creates challenges for both the
customers and the workers. To address these issues,
our proposed system allows anyoneto book workers 
based on their location or area. Workers can register 
at any time, and their information is processed and
presented to customers for easy booking.

In this system there will be a module where 
workers that wish to use this website and reach more 
clients can register themselves by providing their 
personal details. The registered workers will then have 
to verify their identity using an email verification 
system. Once the workers business is deemed
legitimate, the worker can then be posted onto our
website for the customers to view.

have logged in using their username and password, 
they can access the website. To help ease the decisionmaking process for the customers, the workers will be 
displayed on the website from best rated to worst rated. 
There will also be a filter for prices, ratings and
